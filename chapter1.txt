chapter 1

  We meet Nick, Tom, Daisy, and Jordan.

  The narrator of The Great Catsby is a young man from Minnesota named Nick Carraway. He not only narrates the story but casts himself as the bookâ€™s author. He begins by commenting on himself, stating that he learned from his father to reserve judgment about other people, because if he holds them up to his own moral standards, he will misunderstand them. He characterizes himself as both highly moral and highly tolerant.
